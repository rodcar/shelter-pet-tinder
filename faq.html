        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <div>
            <h4>Q: If I find a pet that seems right for me, what happens? May I simply take the pet home?</h4>
            <p>
                The Pet-Shelter app describes the steps and requirements to adopt an animal. If you meet all the
                requirements
                and the
                adoption is approved, you could potentially take your new pet home immediately. However, there are times
                when several
                days are needed to get the required documentation on the vaccinations of your existing pets or lease
                information.

            <h4>Q: Is it difficult to adopt?</h4>
            <p>
                Every shelter has its own policies for approving adoptions. Our adoption screening process is designed
                to ensure that
                each animal is placed with a responsible person, one prepared to make a lifelong commitment with the
                resources available
                to care for and house a pet, so the animal doesn’t end up back in a shelter again. Our first priority is
                to help the
                animal find the best home possible.

            <h4>Q: What can you tell me about the breed of a specific dog?</h4>
            <p>
                Our method for determining the breed of any dog is to evaluate the size, appearance, and temperament
                and, based on
                experience, make our best guess. Mixed breed dogs can be a combination of many generations of mixed
                breed dogs, so it
                isn’t always easy to make an exact guess. Some are easy and others are impossible to determine. DNA
                testing is available
                for breed identification; however, that would be at a cost to the adopter post-adoption.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Q: Are all pets shown online still available? Can you hold a pet for me if I call?</h4>
            <p>
                We update the pets shown online as often as possible. Adopted pets are removed and new pets are added.
                It is highly
                likely that a pet shown online is available. However, our goal is to place homeless pets in permanent
                homes and holding
                them would potentially deny them a home while we wait for someone who may or may not show up and may or
                may not actually
                adopt the pet. If you see a pet online that seems right for you, please call the number shown on each
                online pet
                description and you will be given the up-to-the-minute information on the pet’s availability. If still
                available, we
                recommend you go immediately to meet the pet and fill out an application
                 if you decide that you want to adopt.

            <h4>Q: How long does the adoption process take?</h4>
            <p>
                The length of time that an adoption takes varies widely by type of pet, the number of meet-and-greets
                required, whether
                the pet is in the shelter or in foster care, and the availability of open appointments. Most shelter
                pets receive
                multiple applications, and we recommend that you explore other available shelter pets if you have not
                heard back within
                72 hours.

            <h4>Q: I have other pets. Is that okay?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes! We want to make sure that the animal you're interested in adopting would be compatible with any
                current pets in the
                household. Dogs, rabbits, and guinea pigs may require a same species meet up.
