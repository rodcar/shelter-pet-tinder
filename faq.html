            <h4>
                Q: If I find a pet that seems right for me, what happens? May I simply
                take the pet home?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Pet-Shelter app describes the steps and requirements to adopt an
                animal. If you meet all the requirements and the adoption is approved,
                you could potentially take your new pet home immediately. However,
                there are times when several days are needed to get the required
                documentation on the vaccinations of your existing pets or lease
                information.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-aq-container">
            <h4>Q: Is it difficult to adopt?</h4>
            <p>
                Every shelter has its own policies for approving adoptions. Our
                adoption screening process is designed to ensure that each animal is
                placed with a responsible person, one prepared to make a lifelong
                commitment with the resources available to care for and house a pet,
                so the animal doesn’t end up back in a shelter again. Our first
                priority is to help the animal find the best home possible.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-aq-container">
            <h4>Q: What can you tell me about the breed of a specific dog?</h4>
            <p>
                Our method for determining the breed of any dog is to evaluate the
                size, appearance, and temperament and, based on experience, make our
                best guess. Mixed breed dogs can be a combination of many generations
                of mixed breed dogs, so it isn’t always easy to make an exact guess.
                Some are easy and others are impossible to determine. DNA testing is
                available for breed identification; however, that would be at a cost
                to the adopter post-adoption.

        <div class="faq-aq-container">
            <h4>
                Q: Are all pets shown online still available? Can you hold a pet for
                me if I call?
            </h4>
            <p>
                We update the pets shown online as often as possible. Adopted pets are
                removed and new pets are added. It is highly likely that a pet shown
                online is available. However, our goal is to place homeless pets in
                permanent homes and holding them would potentially deny them a home
                while we wait for someone who may or may not show up and may or may
                not actually adopt the pet. If you see a pet online that seems right
                for you, please call the number shown on each online pet description
                and you will be given the up-to-the-minute information on the pet’s
                availability. If still available, we recommend you go immediately to
                meet the pet and fill out an application  if you decide that you want
                to adopt.

        <div class="faq-aq-container">
            <h4>Q: How long does the adoption process take?</h4>
            <p>
                The length of time that an adoption takes varies widely by type of
                pet, the number of meet-and-greets required, whether the pet is in the
                shelter or in foster care, and the availability of open appointments.
                Most shelter pets receive multiple applications, and we recommend that
                you explore other available shelter pets if you have not heard back
                within 72 hours.

        <div class="faq-aq-container">
            <h4>Q: I have other pets. Is that okay?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes! We want to make sure that the animal you're interested in
                adopting would be compatible with any current pets in the household.
                Dogs, rabbits, and guinea pigs may require a same species meet up.
